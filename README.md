# TripPlanner: My Personal Project 

## Description 

The purpose of trip planner is to *make your vacation as easy, effortless, and organized as
possible*. It will help take the weight of planning your vacation off your shoulders through the use 
of a program that keeps track of your finances during the trip, lets you create an agenda for your
day-to-day activities, and allows you to rate and keep track of previous vacation spots so you 
can remember where you've visited. 

Some *features* of TripPlanner include:
- Including a budget/finance tracker to ensure you stay within your spending limit on a trip
- Create an agenda for your day to day vacation activities
- Make a list of places you want to visit during your vacation
- Allows you to see a quick overview of current/previous trips for easy reference 

## Target Audience 

This project is intended to be used by **anyone who wants to plan a trip**! Whether you're 
someone who loves to go with the flow or wants to have every detail planned out, the wide 
array of features allows for usability from virtually anyone who needs a little extra help 
with their next vacation. 

## Personal Interest

I feel interested in taking on this project because I oftentimes find it difficult to keep on 
top of things when on vacation. Options like Google Docs or Notion are great, but lack structure and are
oftentimes difficult to set up which can feel overwhelming at times. By creating an application that provides you 
a structured and consistent template that you can enter all your trip details in, I hope to make planning for myself and 
others just a little bit easier so people can simply enjoy their vacations rather than stressing about the logistics.
